    <h2>About SECMUN </h2>
    <br>
<p> Founded in 2014, SECMUN — the St. Edmund's College Model United Nations — embodies the college’s enduring motto: <strong>Facta Non Verba</strong> (Deeds Not Words). More than a mere academic simulation, SECMUN is a transformative platform that bridges dialogue and action. <p>

      <p> Our mission is to nurture a generation of globally aware, articulate, and solution-driven leaders within St. Edmund’s College. Through rigorous debate, collaborative negotiation, and immersive simulations, SECMUN develops critical skills in diplomacy, fosters nuanced understanding of global affairs, and promotes the courage to speak with purpose and act with impact. </p>
      <br>
      <p> Firmly embedded in campus life, SECMUN conducts all its programs within the college grounds. We organize three core events annually — EBTV (Executive Board Training and Volunteering), Intra SECMUN, and the flagship Inter SECMUN. These events form a structured pathway for student delegates, offering escalating challenges that sharpen their intellectual agility and diplomatic finesse.</p>
      <br>
      <p> At SECMUN, we believe that ideas alone are not enough. It is the courage to turn insight into initiative that defines true leadership — and that is the legacy we aim to instill. </p>
