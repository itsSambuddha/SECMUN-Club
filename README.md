Well Apparently IK this website dosen't work in GitHub but just for the record, i kept it here so that if I may, i can install this in someone's machine with the required Tech stack and thereafter use the website locally. 
Quite a lengthy and unconventional way of making a website run... but i'm broke as of now. ;)
